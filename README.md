# Java Lab - README

## Overview

This repository contains the lab exercises for the Java programming course conducted by 
**A. H. M. Sajedul Hoque**,
Assistant Professor, 
Department of Computer Science & Engineering,
University of Chittagong.
The experiments are organized into different units, each covering a specific topic related to Java programming. The experiments aim to help students understand core Java concepts through practical implementation.

## Lab Structure

### Unit 1 & Unit 2: Basics
- These units are based on introductory lectures and include simple problem-solving exercises.

### Unit 3: Classes and Objects
1. **Experiment 1:** Design a class to represent a bank account and demonstrate its functionalities without using constructors.
2. **Experiment 2:** Modify the previous program to include constructors for creating bank account objects.

### Unit 4: Method Overloading
3. **Experiment 3:** Implement a "Calculator" class with multiple sum methods using method overloading.
4. **Experiment 4:** Write a program to calculate the area of various shapes (triangle, rectangle, square, and circle) using method overloading.
5. **Experiment 5:** Create an election program to count votes for five candidates, including spoilt ballots.

### Unit 5: Inheritance
6. **Experiment 7:** Implement a program to demonstrate multi-level inheritance for computing a student's CGPA.
7. **Experiment 8:** Design a program to manage employee salary computations, including basic salary, house rent, and provident fund.

### Unit 6: Abstract Classes, Interfaces, and Packages
8. **Experiment 9:** Simulate dog behaviors, demonstrating how different dog breeds eat through method overriding.
9. **Experiment 10:** Model a client class interacting with various vehicle types, with actions like gear change, speed up, and brake.
10. **Experiment 11:** Develop a basic ERP module for Chittagong University focusing on recruiting, enrolling students, and publishing results.

### Unit 7: Exception Handling
11. **Experiment 12:** Create a form-handling module for students' final exam registrations, incorporating various exceptions based on attendance, previous semester failures, dues, and fee payments.

### Unit 8: Multithreaded Programming
12. **Experiment 13:** Develop a multithreaded program to propose new departments in different faculties, simulating real-world meetings.
13. **Experiment 14:** Implement a multithreaded application to count the number of words in a paragraph.

### Unit 9: I/O and GUI Programming
14. **Experiment 15:** Create a GUI-based Java application for employee management, saving details to a file.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans

## Instructions
1. Each experiment is provided with problem statements that need to be solved using Java.
2. Write Java programs following the given specifications.
3. Test and debug the code for each experiment to ensure correctness.

## Running the Programs
1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Create the required Java classes for each experiment.
3. Run the program and observe the output in the console or GUI, as specified.

## Notes
- Each program should include comments to explain the code.
- Proper error handling should be implemented where required.
- Follow the principles of object-oriented programming.
